I would be interested in any recommendations on how to efficiently manage the legal and compliance challenges of turning on-prem customers into cloud users, in particular, when ""cloud add-ons"" are made available to existing on-prem customers who don't yet have cloud terms, data processing agreements, infosec schedules, data transfer clauses, etc., how to palliate those gaps effectively.   * Could ""click-through"" processes executed by IT admins to accept the software vendor's standard terms create enough legal certainty even in cases where those standard terms would significantly alter / override hard-negotiated agreements in place?   * The idea of the business is to make the cloud features available to the customers' IT admins, and have them click through the cloud onboarding process, asking them to represent that they have the legal authority to do so. We as the legal team don't think that this strategy legally bulletproof, but the business doesn't want to introduce ""legal friction"" into the product adoption process.   "

We're a SaaS company that often runs multiple beta programs at once, led by different cross-functional teams. One of our key requirements is that customers must accept our beta terms before participating. This is straightforward for those on our online terms of service, but historically, we didn't embed beta terms into our MSA -- which has led to a lot of manual work. Right now, it's operationally burdensome to track who has accepted the beta terms, since ownership varies by team and there's no standardized intake or tracking process. As our customer base grows, it's becoming increasingly difficult to maintain consistency and compliance.   How did you streamline customer opt-ins and legal acceptance across beta programs?   Did you centralize intake or automate verification?   Any tools, processes, or organizational models that worked well?      Would appreciate any tips or lessons learned. Thanks in advance!

An infringement lawsuit seems pretty unlikely to me, but I can see having to play a lot of defense and make extra concessions during a diligence process.      I was thinking of trying to deploy a third party tool to scan for license conflicts, however that's pricey and I'm not sure how effective they are in catching code stolen from a copyleft library (as opposed to detecting an entire library).

I've done some foundational CLEs in this area, so I'm familiar with the standard guidance (e.g., always keep a human in the loop to avoid hallucinations, avoid fully automated decision-making in connection with these events, ensure all tools are tested for bias, and secure appropriate warranties/indemnities from vendors).

This came up recently when an employee recorded a sensitive internal conversation without notice to others on the line. We are fully remote, so most of our conversations will happen in a context where recording is possible.  As a U.S.-only employer, our privacy policy already makes clear there's no expectation of privacy on company systems, so we're considering a notice-based model for internal calls (e.g. visual + verbal disclosure), rather than requiring express consent. Where we're getting stuck is how to handle sensitive conversations and internal power dynamics. For example:   * If a manager wants to record a challenging conversation with an employee (e.g. to document performance issues), can the employee opt out?   * What if the reverse is true, and an employee wants to record a call with a VP or senior leader during a sensitive conversation? Can the VP shut it down?    * Who and what determines whether a call can't be recorded?   * How do you guardrails to protect trust without creating a surveillance culture or chilling communications?     We're also exploring whether certain categories of conversations (e.g. HR, Legal, mental health support) should be categorically excluded or require advance approval (and from whom).  Would appreciate any thoughts on:   * Internal policies you've implemented and how they're working in practice   * What calls or conversations you never allow to be recorded   * How you balance transparency, documentation needs, and employee trust    * Any procedural controls that help avoid misuse or power imbalances   Thanks in advance.

I've noticed a clear distinction on other AI tools between the plans that include confidentiality obligations and those that don't, regardless of whether they may include language around not training on your data, etc. For example, ChatGPT Pro does not include confidentiality yet ChatGPT Enterprise Pro does. Same for Perplexity.   Cursor's new terms say they will use Content to provide the Service, comply with applicable law, enforce terms and policies, and keep the Service safe.  But there is no ""only"". They also say they won't train with the Content unless explicitly agreed. This does not feel like sufficient protection for source code. Am I missing something?

That core team of 4 then led a complete pivot - they built a different product, sold via a different channel to a different customer. This is a significant new financial product - you could say this team invented it - and its looking good.  Board would like to recognize (and have the market and the team recognize) this core team of 4 as founders. And they're willing to invest some energy and reasonable expense to get that done. Just naming them founders wouldn't feel right to them since they didn't technically start the business and they respect the guy who did. After the founder left, we considered simply forming a new company actually founded by the core team of 4, but QSBS considerations prevailed and we did a recap instead.  Has anyone worked through ""reconstituting"" the founders of a startup? A negotiated arrangement with the actual founder may be possible, but particularly interested in any alternatives you've seen.

I've recently joined my current company and have been looking into this issue as part of a broader payroll system transition. I've proposed the standard compliant route: reclassifying certain roles from exempt to non-exempt, tracking actual time worked via timesheets, and clearly ""providing"" (but not policing) meal and rest breaks in line with CA law. The plan would include having employees sign updated break policies and certify weekly on timesheets that they were offered all required breaks. Potentially it would also include a mechanism for pre-approval of overtime. That said -- I've been asked (unsurprisingly) whether other tech companies have found more ""elegant"" solutions. The concern isn't just about the admin of tracking hours -- it's also the cost of paying overtime. I'm fully aware of the legal requirements, but I need to understand what others are doing in practice -- especially in go-to-market orgs where the business feels that hourly classification undermines culture or incentives.

This seems a crazy outcome to not allow them to benefit from the EMI price - so am looking to see if anyone can corroborate this / has experience with practical alternatives that don't penalise the employees.

There was a lot of debate on the topic, so I wanted to share this benchmarking report on The State of AI in Business Communications. Enjoy!  Meeting & Communication AI Trends:   AI meeting assistants are going mainstream: Top features in demand include:   CRM integration (49%)   Real-time transcription (47%)   Automated call summaries (44%)   Voice-to-text & sentiment analysis (36-40%)   Voice analysis is hot: 81% plan to invest in AI for analyzing voice data within 12 months. Half already have clear strategies in place.   Executives are driving adoption: C-level execs are the most active users and champions of AI meeting tech (91% are leading voice AI adoption).   High ROI use cases: Voice data tools are linked to faster resolutions, fewer complaints, increased upsell opportunities, and lower agent burnout.   But… Security is a concern:   72% expect AI-generated fraud (e.g. deepfake voices) in the next year.   Yet, 31% of companies still haven't implemented fraud prevention tools.   Smaller orgs especially lack resources/confidence in detecting fraud.      The Bigger Picture:   97% of businesses expect to increase AI investment in the next 3-5 years.   Customer service and internal collaboration are the most common early applications.   AI is moving from automation -> augmentation--helping teams think, not just do. "

Customers want reps about how the LLM was trained (even though we use a 3rd party LLM), reps and indemnification for outputs (even though that is highly dependent on user inputs) and a real blurring of lines between what type of information we own and can use for product improvement and what the customer owns and we can't use.

I wanted to reach out to see if anyone has experience with Quebec Bill 96, especially regarding advertising online and selling via ecommerce in Quebec. Curious how you addressed the French language requirements relating to advertising and your website. Compliance seems pretty straight forward (but also technically challenging as these rules only apply to one geographic area in a larger market), but did anyone end up hiring local counsel to help with compliance? If so, could you share referrals? "

Our leadership team is exploring ways to streamline the signature process for sales documents, especially standardized and low-risk order forms. From a legal perspective, we have some concerns -- particularly around the use of customer-preferred e-signature platforms, which could introduce risks such as untracked changes to terms or document metadata. I'm curious how other companies have approached this. Have you implemented a more efficient process for signing these types of documents? If so, how have you balanced speed and automation with the need to mitigate legal and compliance risks? I'd appreciate hearing examples or best practices -- especially approaches that have maintained control over contract integrity while enabling a smoother buyer experience. "

Particularly interested to hear from folks in-house that have deep employment and labor experience, or where employment and HR rolls up under them. We have a set of Independent Contractors that, if they provided the same service to a competitor, would be very detrimental.  And, this is a negotiated point.  Perhaps a euphemism, but I would describe the relationship as ""exclusive"" as opposed to ""subject to a non-compete. Assume:   * independent contractor and industry is super-specific & niche   * ""exclusivity"" would be for the term of the engagement and for a ""reasonable"" time afterwards (say like a year).   * Exclusivity (non-compete) would be geographically limited in scope.   Ignore:   * CA, ND, OK and MN - I don't think this flies in those states b/c of their sweeping and broad rules that prohibit non-competes, and specific call-outs to ""independent contractors""   * The 2024 FTC ban (or, assume the FTC stands down next month on their current appeal as many signs point to that happening).   Bonus points for form language that has been vetted by an SME. "

We have weekly team leads meetings to flag anything relevant across teams, and then each lead also has regular 1:1s with the GC to go deeper on team-specific blockers or critical matters. That said, we're realizing these syncs just aren't enough time to cover everything the GC wants (or needs) visibility into. There's a lot happening across teams, and not all of it fits neatly into a weekly meeting or 1:1. On top of that, it's unrealistic to expect the GC to stay on top of every Jira task or dig through various team-level reports. We want to find a smarter, more consistent way to report what the GC should know - without creating more manual work for lawyers or overloading the GC with too much detail. We track most work in Jira, so I'm thinking of an automated weekly summary (""newsletter"") based on tagged issues, status changes, and comments. But we also have projects tracked in Sheets, Docs, etc., so it's not all in one place. Has anyone found a good system or workflow to regularly surface the most important team updates to your GC - especially across tools and teams - in a way that's low-effort but high-signal? Would love any ideas or lessons learned. "
