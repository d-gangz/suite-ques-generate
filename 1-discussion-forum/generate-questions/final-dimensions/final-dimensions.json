We as the legal team don't think that this strategy legally bulletproof, but the business doesn't want to introduce \"legal friction\" into the product adoption process.   ",

          "Has anyone created a policy governing internal call recordings and transcriptions? This came up recently when an employee recorded a sensitive internal conversation without notice to others on the line. We are fully remote, so most of our conversations will happen in a context where recording is possible.  As a U.S.-only employer, our privacy policy already makes clear there's no expectation of privacy on company systems, so we're considering a notice-based model for internal calls (e.g. visual + verbal disclosure), rather than requiring express consent. Where we're getting stuck is how to handle sensitive conversations and internal power dynamics. For example:   * If a manager wants to record a challenging conversation with an employee (e.g. to document performance issues), can the employee opt out?   * What if the reverse is true, and an employee wants to record a call with a VP or senior leader during a sensitive conversation? Can the VP shut it down?    * Who and what determines whether a call can't be recorded?   * How do you guardrails to protect trust without creating a surveillance culture or chilling communications?     We're also exploring whether certain categories of conversations (e.g. HR, Legal, mental health support) should be categorically excluded or require advance approval (and from whom).  Would appreciate any thoughts on:   * Internal policies you've implemented and how they're working in practice   * What calls or conversations you never allow to be recorded   * How you balance transparency, documentation needs, and employee trust    * Any procedural controls that help avoid misuse or power imbalances   Thanks in advance.
