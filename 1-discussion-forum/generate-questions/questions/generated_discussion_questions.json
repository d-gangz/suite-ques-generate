Looking for strong employee‑side employment counsel in Washington State (Seattle preferred) that: (a) handles high‑stakes individual claims (age discrimination, retaliation) in both state and federal court, (b) is comfortable taking depositions and trying cases if needed, and (c) is not BigLaw — ideally a boutique or experienced solo with tech employer experience and reasonable rates. Two specific asks: 1) Any recommendations in Seattle/WA (or firms in Portland/Bay Area that routinely handle WA matters through local counsel)? Please include names, any known recent wins, and whether you’ve worked with them on hybrid fee arrangements. 2) What are market norms for fee structures on senior individual employment matters (reduced hourly + success bonus, contingency splits, typical retainers) so I can set expectations for the client? Client wants counsel engaged within ~2–3 weeks. Appreciate recommendations.",

Looking for market benchmarks across a few related issues as we try to put clean corporate and IP foundations in place before fundraising: 1) Founder vesting/repurchase — what's the current standard for cliff/vesting when some founders are continuing full-time and one is staying part-time (do you use full four-year with 1-year cliff for everyone, accelerated carve-outs, or different treatment for the part-timer)? 2) Consultant-to-cofounder conversions — do you typically convert early paid consultants to common equity (and if so under what vesting/pricing), or leave them on advisory SAFE/option grants until formal diligence? 3) Background employer IP risk — if a founder previously worked at a large employer with a broad invention assignment policy, what practical diligence and contractual protections (representations, indemnities, escrow of source, employer clearance letters) do you ask for pre-seed? 4) Diligence docs for investors — what minimal IP/assignment templates or founder representations have you found are acceptable at pre-seed so we don’t scare off investors but still get solid protection? Any templates or short-form language you use (or cautions from prior deal friction) would be really helpful — appreciate any practical benchmarking or examples.",

If opt-out is allowed, how do you handle disputes about who initiated the record? 4) Retention, access, and e-discovery hooks — sample retention schedules, access controls, and how you integrate recordings/transcripts into litigation holds. 5) Implementation tips: rollout communications, training scripts, and any tech integrations (Zoom/Teams settings, logging) that made enforcement workable.

      "question": "We're a Series C SaaS company (US HQ, material EU/UK customer base and some APAC deals) preparing to enable a paid cloud add‑on for hundreds of on‑prem enterprise customers that signed older MSAs with no cloud terms, DPAs, infosec schedules, or cross‑border transfer clauses. Business wants a near zero‑friction product onboarding experience (IT admin click‑through) rather than re‑negotiating MSAs—legal is wary. Asking for a practical playbook: what combination of contracting (click‑through T&Cs, lightweight amendment, emailed DPA + EEA/UK SCCs, infosec questionnaire), technical controls, and risk allocation (warranties, indemnities, liability caps) have others used to scale this safely without reopening every MSA? Specifics that would help: language examples for admin click‑through consent and authority, minimum DPA/amendment templates you’d accept, handling customers in China or with strict localization needs, who on the legal ops team should own the workflow, and whether you used CLM/automation to push these at scale.

Legal is worried: the cloud onboarding would introduce DPA/infosec schedules, cross-border transfer clauses, new liability allocations, and data processing modes not contemplated by existing MSAs.

Would you treat a click-through as an amendment, a side‑letter, or a new agreement? (2) For high-risk / enterprise customers who refuse click-throughs, what operational playbook have you used — requiring a countersigned amendment, gating features, offering a stripped-down “cloud lite” with only limited telemetry, or escalating to sales/execs — and how did you quantify/accept residual legal risk vs commercial impact?

A few specific asks: 1) What representations/confirmations from the IT admin (language and scope) actually help establish authority to bind the customer—and are there red flags where you still require signed amendments? 2) For customers with heavily negotiated master agreements (no cloud terms today), when is click‑through sufficient versus when should we require counter‑signature or an SOW? Any triage rules you use (deal size, sector, export/localization risk)? 3) Operationally, what minimal evidence/audit trail do you collect to defend a later challenge (timestamps, IP, admin identity proofing, logging, contractual acceptance screens)? 4) How do you structure the cloud terms/DPA so they don’t unintentionally “override” bespoke legacy provisions (e.g., indemnities, limitations, data localization) but also don’t create infinite negotiation friction? 5) Any clause snippets, playbooks, or real‑world war stories where click‑through worked—or failed—would be hugely helpful.",

Where we're getting stuck is how to handle sensitive conversations and internal power dynamics. For example:   * If a manager wants to record a challenging conversation with an employee (e.g. to document performance issues), can the employee opt out?   * What if the reverse is true, and an employee wants to record a call with a VP or senior leader during a sensitive conversation? Can the VP shut it down?    * Who and what determines whether a call can't be recorded?   * How do you guardrails to protect trust without creating a surveillance culture or chilling communications?     We're also exploring whether certain categories of conversations (e.g. HR, Legal, mental health support) should be categorically excluded or require advance approval (and from whom).  Would appreciate any thoughts on:   * Internal policies you've implemented and how they're working in practice   * What calls or conversations you never allow to be recorded   * How you balance transparency, documentation needs, and employee trust    * Any procedural controls that help avoid misuse or power imbalances   Thanks in advance.

This is straightforward for those on our online terms of service, but historically, we didn't embed beta terms into our MSA -- which has led to a lot of manual work. Right now, it's operationally burdensome to track who has accepted the beta terms, since ownership varies by team and there's no standardized intake or tracking process. As our customer base grows, it's becoming increasingly difficult to maintain consistency and compliance.   How did you streamline customer opt-ins and legal acceptance across beta programs?   Did you centralize intake or automate verification?   Any tools, processes, or organizational models that worked well?      Would appreciate any tips or lessons learned. Thanks in advance!
